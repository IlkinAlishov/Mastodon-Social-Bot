## ✨ Features

* **Daily Post Limiting:** Uses Mastodon's API to check if a post has been made today, preventing spam.
* **Trend Fetching:** Pulls the top trending hashtags for timely content.
* **Creative Generation:** Utilizes the OpenAI API to craft posts in a **sarcastic or creative tone**.
* **Easy Setup:** One-command script for environment configuration.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Setup)

Getting the bot running is quick! You'll need Python 3.11+ and an API key from both **OpenAI** and your chosen **Mastodon instance**.

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IlkinAlishov/Mastodon-Social-Bot/
    cd ai-trend-bot
    ```

2. **Initialize Environment & Install Dependencies**

    This script creates the virtual environment (`.venv`), activates it, and installs everything listed in `requirements.txt`.

    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup_env.sh
    ```

3. **Configure Secrets**

    Copy the example file and edit it to include your actual API tokens and base URL.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Now, open .env in your editor and fill in the values!
    ```

## 🏃 Running the Bot

### Manual Execution

Run the bot once to test the full pipeline. If a post has already been made today, the bot will exit gracefully.

```bash
./scripts/run_bot.sh
````

### Automation (Scheduling)

For automatic daily posting, we recommend using a scheduler like `cron` on a dedicated server or VPS. Set the job to run once per day (e.g., at 9:00 AM server time).

```bash
# Add this line to your crontab (-e)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/ai-trend-bot && ./scripts/run_bot.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Python package layout, making it easy to test and maintain.

## 🧪 Testing

We use `pytest` for unit testing the API client mocking. Ensure your virtual environment is active and the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly (or use the simple execution method below).

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/
```
